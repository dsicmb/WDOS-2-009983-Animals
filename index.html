                <p>A group of herbivores called ruminants have specialized stomachs. For the digestion of plant matter, 
                    ruminant stomachs have more than one chamber. When a ruminant chews up and swallows grass, leaves, and

                    specialized bacteria break down the food. When the material is soft enough, the animal regurgitates the 
                    food and chews it again. This helps break down the plant matter. This partially digested food is called cud. 
                    The animal then swallows the cud, and it goes into a second chamber of the stomach. Chemicals in the second 
                    chamber digest the plant material further, and it goes into the third chamber. Finally, the digested food goes 
                    to the fourth chamber, which is similar to a human stomach. Sheep, deer, giraffes, camels, and cattle are 
                    all ruminants.

                <p>An omnivore is an organism that eats plants and animals. The term stems from the Latin words omnis, 
                    meaning “all or everything,” and vorare, meaning “to devour or eat.”

                    <span class="more">
                    Omnivores play an important part of the food chain, a sequence of organisms that produce energy and 
                    nutrients for other organisms. Every food chain consists of several trophic levels, which describe an 
                    organism’s role in an ecosystem. Omnivores generally occupy the third trophic level alongside 
                    meat-eating carnivores.
                    Omnivores are a diverse group of animals. Examples of omnivores include bears, birds, dogs, raccoons, 
                    foxes, certain insects, and even humans.

            <p>Animals that hunt, mate, or are generally active after dark have special adaptations that make it easier 
                to live the night life.There’s a reason why people who stay up late are called night owls. That’s because 
                <span class="dots">...</span>
                <span class="more">
                owls are always awake and active when the sun is down. This is called nocturnal behavior, and it’s common 
                among many animals. They become more active at night to hunt, mate, or avoid heat and predators.
                Nocturnal animals have evolved physical traits that let them roam in the dark more effectively. The eyes 
                get bigger and the pupils widen. Owl eyes, for example, are so big that they can’t move in the socket, but 
                their wide pupils help them collect more light.A reflective layer called tapetum sits behind the retina; any 
                light that passes through the eye reflects back onto the tapetum. The retinas contain rod cells, which pack 
                their DNA in a way that turns each cell’s nucleus into a light-collecting lens. This is different from how 
                the rods of non-nocturnal animals or humans work.

                <p>Amphibians are small vertebrates that need water, or a moist environment, to survive. The species in this group 
                    include frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts. All can breathe and absorb water through their very thin skin.

                    <span class="more">
                    Amphibians also have special skin glands that produce useful proteins. Some transport water, oxygen, and carbon 
                    dioxide either into or out of the animal. Others fight bacteria or fungal infections. And at least one—in each 
                    species—is used for defense.To warn potential predators, the most toxic amphibians are also the most brightly 
                    colored. Curare [kyoo-RAW-ree], for example, is found on the skin of colorful poison dart frogs. Another special 
                    feature of most amphibians is their egg-larva-adult life cycle. The larvae are aquatic and free-swimming—frogs and 
                    toads at this stage are called tadpoles. At a certain size, the young develop limbs and lungs. Some also lose their 
                    tails. Eventually, they hop or climb out of the water as adults, and spend the rest of their lives on land. This 
                    process is known as metamorphosis..

                <p>Reptiles are air-breathing vertebrates covered in special skin made up of scales, bony plates, or a combination of both.
                They include crocodiles, snakes, lizards, turtles, and tor- toises. All regularly shed the outer layer of their skin.

                Their metabolism depends on the temperature of their environment.Unlike birds and mammals, reptiles do not maintain a constant 
                internal body temperature. Without fur or feathers for insulation, they cannot stay warm on a cold day, and without sweat glands 
                the ability to pant, they cannot cool off on a hot one. Instead, they move into the sun or into the shade as needed. During cooler 
                parts of the year they become inactive. Because of their slow metabolism and heat-seeking behavior, reptiles are cold-blooded.
                Reptile reproduction also depends on temperature. Only boas and pythons give birth to live young. The other species lay their 
                eggs in a simple nest, and leave. The young hatch days to months later. The soil temperature is critical during this time: It 
                determines how many hatchlings will be male or female. Young reptiles can glide, walk, and swim within hours of birth. Reptiles 
                first appear in the fossil record 315 million years ago and were the dominant animals during the Mesozoic era, which lasted for 
                270 million years until the extinction of the dinosaurs.

                <p>All insects belong to the phylum Arthropoda. But unlike other arthropods—like lobsters, spiders, or millipedes—insects have 
                    three pairs of jointed legs, segmented bodies, an exoskeleton, one pair of antennae, and (usually) one or two pairs of wings.

                    Insects live in nearly every habitat, and it’s estimated that there are currently 10 quintillion insects on the globe. So far 
                    scientists who study bugs, called entomologists, have named one million insect species but studies estimate that four million 
                    are still uncategorized. The oldest insect fossil—a mandible (or jaw) found in Scotland—is between 408 and 438 million years 
                    old. The oldest winged fossil dates back 330 million years ago, suggesting that insects were among the first animals to leave 
                    the oceans for land during the Devonian period some 400 million years ago. Insects are vital to every ecosystem. They pollinate 
                    plants, decompose plant and animal matter, and are themselves a source of food. Birds alone are estimated to eat 400 to 500 million 
                    tons of insects per year.

                <p>All fish share two traits: they live in water and they have a backbone—they are vertebrates. Apart from these similarities, 
                    however, many of the species in this group differ markedly from one another. Fin fish like salmon have gills, are covered
                    <span class="dots">...</span>
                    <span class="more"> 
                    in scales, and reproduce by laying eggs. Eels, by contrast, have worm-like bodies and exceedingly slimy skin. Lungfish gulp 
                    air. Whale sharks, the largest fish, give birth to live young and eat only tiny fish, squid, and plankton. Some species, such 
                    as the weedy sea dragon, are so bizarre they seem almost unreal. Fish have developed special senses, too. Because water 
                    transmits sounds, disperses chemicals, and conducts electricity better than air, fish rely less on their vision and more on 
                    their hearing, taste, and smell. Many can detect motion in the water using a special row of scales with sensors known as the 
                    lateral line. Others can find their prey and even navigate by detecting electrical charges. One reason fish are so diverse is 
                    that 70 percent of the planet is covered in water. The animals in this group live in a variety of habitats ranging from coral 
                    reefs and kelp forests to rivers, streams, and the open ocean.

                    marine environments for feeding and survival. Marine mammal adaptation to an aquatic lifestyle varies considerably between 
                    species. Both cetaceans and sirenians are fully aquatic and therefore are obligate water dwellers. Seals and sea-lions are 
                    semiaquatic; they spend the majority of their time in the water but need to return to land for important activities such as 
                    mating, breeding and molting. In contrast, both otters and the polar bear are much less adapted to aquatic living. The diets 
                    of marine mammals vary considerably as well; some eat zooplankton, others eat fish, squid, shellfish, or sea-grass, and a few 
                    eat other mammals.

                    ostrich. The smallest is the two-inch-long bee hummingbird. Everything about the anatomy of a bird reflects its ability to fly. 
                    wings, for example, are shaped to create lift. The leading edge is thicker than the back edge, and they are covered in feathers 
                    that narrow to a point. Airplane wings are modeled after bird wings. The bones and muscles of the wing are also highly 
                    specialized. The main bone, the humerus, which is similar to the upper arm of a mammal, is hollow instead of solid. It also 
                    connects to the bird’s air sac system, which, in turn, connects to its lungs. The powerful flight muscles of the shoulder 
                    attach to the keel, a special ridge of bone that runs down the center of the wide sternum, or breastbone.

            <p>Formerly called Ceylon junglefowl, the Sri Lankan junglefowl is the national bird of Sri Lanka. It appears on postage stamps there.
               The terrestrial Sri Lanka junglefowl is an omnivore. Its diet includes grass seeds, seed pods, berries, flower petals, and a variety of small invertebrates 
               including termites, ants, beetles, ticks, centipedes, grasshoppers and mollusks. <br><br>
               When eating, it scratches and pecks at the ground like a domestic chicken.
               This bird is found only in Sri Lanka – the island nation off of the southeast tip of India. It lives in a variety of habitats between sea level and 6,500 feet 
               elevation, including dry forest, coastal scrub, damp mountain forest and tea plantations.<br><br>
               
            <h3>Sri Lankan junglefowls are common and are not considered threatened. The population is thought to be stable.
